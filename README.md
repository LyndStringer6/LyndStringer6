oi- 👋 Hi, I’m @LyndStringer6
- 👀 I’m interested in Elementary Number Theory (ENT).  

I was working in High Performance Computing (HPC) but my project's fund ran out and I'm looking for another job.  
I am an expert software performance engineer.  That has been my day job for several decades.  But I'm always had 
an interest in number theory; I find it the purest mathematics. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on teaching ENT
